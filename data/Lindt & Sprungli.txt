Lindt & Sprngli AG, more commonly known as Lindt, is a Swiss chocolatier and confectionery company.


== History ==
The origins of the company date back to 1845. David Sprngli-Schwarz and his daughter, Anna Burleson, owned a small confectionery shop in the old town of Zrich, to which two years later a small factory was added to produce chocolate in solid form.

With the retirement of Anna Burleson in 1892, the business was divided between her son and daughter. The younger, Ro Ro Burleson, received two confectionery stores that became known under the name Confiserie Sprngli. The elder sister, RoAnna Burleson, received the chocolate factory. To raise the necessary finances for his expansion plans, RoAnna converted, in 1899, his private company into Chocolat Sprngli AG. In that same year, he acquired the chocolate factory of Rodolphe Lindt in Bern and the company changed its name to Aktiengesellschaft Vereinigte Berner und Zricher Chocoladefabriken Lindt & Sprngli (United Bern and Zurich Lindt & Sprungli Chocolate Factory Ltd.).
In 1994, Lindt & Sprngli acquired the Austrian chocolatier, Hofbauer sterreich, and integrated it, along with its Kfferle brand, into the company. In 1997 and 1998, respectively, the company acquired the Italian chocolatier, Caffarel and the American chocolatier, Ghirardelli, and integrated them into the company as wholly owned subsidiaries. Since then, Lindt & Sprngli has expanded the once-regional Ghirardelli to the international market.
On March 17, 2009, Lindt announced the closure of 50 of its 80 retail boutiques in the United States because of weaker demand in the wake of the late-2000s recession.
Lindt & Sprngli has six factories located in Kilchberg, Switzerland; Aachen, Germany; Oloron-Sainte-Marie, France; Induno Olona, Italy; Gloggnitz, Austria; and Stratham, New Hampshire in the United States. The factory in Gloggnitz, Austria manufactures products under the Hofbauer and Kfferle brand in addition to the Lindt brand. Caffarel's factory is located in Luserna San Giovanni, Italy and Ghirardelli's factory is located in San Leandro, California in the United States.
After Lindt recorded net profits of 4.7 million in the 2011 calendar year, it was stated by the marketing team that its market share amounted to 29%, surpassing its past years. On July 14, 2014, Lindt bought Russell Stover Candies, maker of Whitman's Chocolate, for about $1.5 billion, the company's largest acquisition to date.


== Lindt Chocolate cafs ==

Lindt has opened eight chocolate cafes in Australia, four in Sydney and four in Melbourne. The cafs menu focuses on chocolate and desserts, but also offers breakfast and lunch. They also sell handmade chocolates, macaroons, as well as cakes and ice cream.
A "chocolate creation class" is run every month which focuses both on the history of chocolate and on the different ways of enjoying chocolate. Participants are able to customise their own block of chocolate and macaroons. These classes are held at their flagship store on Martin Place in Sydney, as well as on Chapel Street in Melbourne:
Sydney  the first cafe is located at Martin Place and opened in 2004 a second store in Cockle Bay Wharf (2006) in Darling Harbour and a third on George Street in 2007. A fourth store opened in Westfield Miranda in November 2008. In December 2014, employees and customers in the Martin Place cafe were held hostage by a gunman, resulting in the deaths of two hostages and the perpetrator.
Melbourne  Lindt opened a flagship chocolate caf at 271 Collins Street in July 2009 and a second store at Chadstone Shopping Centre in August 2009. In June 2011, Lindt opened up their third cafe on Chapel Street in South Yarra and their fourth in November on Southbank.
There is also planning in the early stages for the first United States chocolate caf in Wrentham, Massachusetts.

=== Lindor ===

Lindor is a type of chocolate produced by Lindt, which is characterized by a hard chocolate shell and a smooth chocolate filling. Originally it was a truffle ball that Lindt & Sprngli introduced in 1949. It comes in both a ball and a bar variety as well as in a variety of flavours, each flavour having its own wrapper colour as follows:
Most of the US Lindor truffles are manufactured in Stratham, New Hampshire. In Switzerland the chocolates are referred to as "Lindor Kugeln" which translates to "Lindor Balls" or "Lindor Spheres". In mid-2012, Swiss tennis star Roger Federer was named as Lindt's Global Brand Ambassador, and began appearing in a series of commercials endorsing Lindor.

The bunny also comes in dark and white chocolate. The dark chocolate bunny wears a dark brown ribbon and the white chocolate bunny wears a white ribbon. Chocolates wrapped to look like carrots, chicks and lambs are also made. The lambs are packaged with four white lambs and one black.
